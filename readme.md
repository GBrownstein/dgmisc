# dgmisc

Daniel and Gretchen's miscellaneous R functions for research.  Primarily used as vehicle for documenting, distributing and maintaining otherwise disjointed bits of code.

## Installation
This package is not now, nor will it ever likely be, on CRAN but you can install it from here on GitHub using Hadley Wickham's `devtools` package.

1. `install.packages('devtools')`
2. `install_github('dgmisc', username='dpritchard')`
3. `library(dgmisc)`

## Contributing
I welcome contributors of all skill levels!  If you would like to contribute to this project please [contact me][dpcontact].  

If you'd like to contribute, please read [Hadley Wickham's style guide][hwsg] before spending too much time coding out a complex function for inclusion here.
